To setup your project correctly, you MUST follow the instructions below:
https://github.com/aelkz/node-google-apps-script

TIPS:
- Your library scripts can be external from your 2 working sheets (LIBRARY and FEATURE) or;
- Your library scripts can be internal into your sheets using google sheets embedded script editor (hiding your source code from public users).

WARNING: In order to create a public plugin, you must follow additional instructions on how to create a external google drive plugin (this will enable your plugin for public use). In this project I have used an internal approach (all scripts are inside each sheet)

LIBRARY sheet (you should create a new copy for you):
